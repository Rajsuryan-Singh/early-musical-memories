I remember that she would softly tap her hands along with the beats of the song, on my head, chest or back and I would instantly go to sleep no matter how my mood was. It was a very positive experience for me and I really cherish those memories. 
As I am attempting this survey, I realize how complex the songs actually were. The one I remember is in 6/8 and it is in a scale which is called the Malahari Raaga which is a kind of minor key feel and has a very interesting sound to it. It is pretty difficult to describe this in a western music context. But I think this might be interesting to mention for this survey.",I don't remember exactly but my mom had done this since I was a baby.

The songs were played in my living room and they could be heard everywhere in my home. It was a pretty positive experience and I liked to tap my foot, or bob my head to the songs even though I didn't understand most of it.",4,4,"Loved, Joyful, Peaceful",The music was from the TV show Oswald. I used to watch that show all the time and sing those songs to myself. The songs were very short and simple to follow and understand and most of the songs were very happy songs.,3 or 4 years old,4,5,"Joyful, Peaceful","I think the very first 'performance' type of memory for me is when I played the major scale on the guitar for my family which is pretty hilarious for me to write out. I played every new thing like chords, simple songs, etc. I learned from my teacher back then, in front of my parents and sister and they were very happy. ",10,4,5,"Loved, Hopeful, Joyful, Relieved, Peaceful","My first proper performance in front of an audience was during a new year celebration with the people who lived in my locality. I played two songs solo on stage. I played either just the melody or just the chords for some sections of both the songs. In retrospect, it wasn't the best performance, but in the moment, I had an absolutely great time playing it and I was extremely happy afterwards",11,5,5,"Loved, Hopeful, Joyful, Relieved, Surprised, Stressed","We have a very basic small keyboard in my house and I used to play random stuff on it without much thought. The very first time I played that keyboard, I think I was most intrigued by the black and white keys and what they meant. I think my mom taught me about the C major key that day. But I was still confused by what the black keys are. And then I just messed around and played random stuff later. I also messed with these buttons on top which played simple 4/4 drum loops, or the metronome, or some simple kids songs like twinkle twinkle, jingle bells, etc. It was a very fun thing for me to mess around on that keyboard.",Maybe 6,3,4,"Joyful, Surprised","My very first memory of a music class for playing the guitar is being frustrated at how difficult it is to play a single note cleanly and how much I had to stretch my fingers. I went to my teacher, on the day after I bought the guitar. He taught me about all the basic things like holding the guitar, the hand position, holding the pick, etc. Then came the part where I had to play just single notes cleanly which was very difficult for me to do as a 10 year old. He told me that I shouldn't feel bad because I was just 10 years old, with small fingers, playing on a full sized guitar and he told me practice everyday. I spent the whole day afterwards trying to play single notes cleanly and it felt very gratifying later.",10,5,4,"Hopeful, Joyful, Relieved, Surprised, Infuriated"
